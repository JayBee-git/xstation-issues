## Games freeze, FMV stutter or stall, audio skips
The xStation needs a well performing SD card that can deliver CD data reliably in under 6.7ms.   
To help the SD card, format it using the official formatter tool. It really helps with access times:   
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/   
The tool will automatically choose exFAT and set correct alignments and cluster sized.   
If the issue persists:
- try a different SD card to see whether the problem is with the card or the installation
- double check the installation, make sure that the pads below the lifted pins do not make contact
- The lid open/close switch can be worn and barely make continous contact. Try wedging in something that pushes it down properly.
